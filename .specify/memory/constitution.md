# AI/Spec-Driven Book using Docusaurus + GitHub Pages Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy
All claims must be backed by verified, authoritative sources. Simple Markdown references are required for citations, with at least 30% of sources being official documentation, standards, or academic papers.

### II. Clarity
Content must be written for a technical audience with a target Flesch Reading Ease score between 60 and 75.

### III. Consistency
A consistent writing style and tone must be maintained across all chapters. All content must adhere to the Docusaurus structure for sidebars and pages.

### IV. Reproducibility
All instructions and code examples must be tested, runnable, and produce the expected results.

### V. AI Alignment
All outputs generated by AI must strictly follow this constitution.

## Key Standards

- All claims must be source-backed.
- Citation style: simple Markdown references.
- At least 30% authoritative sources (official docs, standards, academic).
- Code examples must be tested and runnable.
- Writing clarity: Flesch score 60–75.
- Follow Docusaurus structure (sidebars, pages).

## Project Constraints

- The book will contain 8–12 chapters.
- Each chapter will be between 800–1500 words.
- The final output must be in MDX-ready Markdown.
- The project must build and deploy cleanly on GitHub Pages.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for project standards and supersedes all other practices. All contributions and reviews must verify compliance. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
