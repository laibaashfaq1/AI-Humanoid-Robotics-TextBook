## Prompt

connect my backend to frontend

## Response snapshot

I have created the `README.md` file in the `src` directory.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Added a `README.md` file to the frontend to improve its documentation.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created `src/README.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: The frontend was already connected to the backend. I added a `README.md` file to the frontend to make it easier to understand and run.
