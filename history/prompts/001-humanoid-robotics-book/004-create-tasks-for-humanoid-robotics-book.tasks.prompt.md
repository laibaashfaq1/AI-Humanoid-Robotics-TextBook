## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

The `tasks.md` file has been successfully generated for the 'Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book' feature.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed, actionable task list has been created, breaking down the entire book-writing process into manageable, dependency-ordered tasks.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: `specs/001-humanoid-robotics-book/tasks.md` was created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now begin implementation by following the tasks in `tasks.md`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task generation was successful, leveraging the previously created design documents to produce a comprehensive plan.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): n/a
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
